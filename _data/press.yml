    where people are not only sharing the most,  but also where people are using
    their most authentic voice to communicate with their closest friends and
    family.

    AI-powered assistants like chatbots have already changed the way we handle

    follow a script of pre-programmed responses. Patrick Perrin, PhD, Chief
    Scientist, Head of AI and Research at Emogi, discusses how Conversational AI
    will take things a step further by creating helpful responses, tailored not
    only to tone, but also to situations. AI will become our conversational
    side-kick, enhancing our understanding of human conversations and
    transforming the way we interact through messaging.
