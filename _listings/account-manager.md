Holler's mission is to enrich conversations everywhere with useful content in the place where people share the most—messaging.

We’re a content platform that helps people discover the perfect sticker or GIF in messaging apps. Every day, millions of people use Holler to have richer conversations with content that improves their self-expression in chat.

Holler surfaces relevant content for people to use as natural part of their conversation, based on the unique context of their chat, such as location, use of certain phrases or emoji, or other triggers such as time of day. For example, a person texting and walking into a coffee shop can instantly discover and share coffee-related stickers and GIFs inside their messaging app that improves their communication with their friends.
