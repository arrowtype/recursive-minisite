## A highly customizable new variable font.

Built to maximize versatility, control, and performance, Recursive is a five-axis variable font. This enables you to choose from a wide range of predefined styles, or dial in exactly what you want for each of its axes: *Proportion, Monospace, Weight, Slant, and Italic*. Taking full advantage of variable font technology, Recursive offers an unprecedented level of flexibility, all from a single font file.

## Extraordinarily versatile.

Recursive draws inspiration from single-stroke casual signpainting, a style of brush writing that is stylistically flexible and warmly energetic. Adapting this aesthetic basis into a type system, Recursive is designed to excel in digital interactive environments. This makes the typeface ideal for a wide range of uses, including data-rich apps, technical documentation and code editors.

### One font. Infinite combinations.

Recursive is crafted with adaptability and diversity in mind, offering a complete type system but ensuring that each style can pair perfectly with its siblings. With so many possible variations across its subfamilies, weights and styles, Recursive allows for a dozen of font combinations that provide enough contrast to clearly define typographic roles, while maintaining a cohesive voice.


## Sans && Mono. In one file. `MONO`

The typeface comes in two practical and highly readable subfamilies, Sans and Mono. Thanks to its *Monospace* axis (`MONO`) both of these subfamilies can be used in a single font file. You can even select custom instances that are semi-proportional or semi-monospaced. 

Also, vertical metrics such as line height, cap height, and x-height are shared across the entire *Monospace* axis. This allows harmonious and performant layouts, even where different proportions are mixed, such as in data-rich applications and technical documentation. 

*Recursive Sans* is made for text & user interface design. While its proportional characters deliver comfortable reading at text sizes, its heaviest weights are perfect to create punchy, tightly-spaced headlines.

*Recursive Mono* is made for code. Its characters share the same width for clear legibility and perfect alignment. This is particularly helpful for use in programming and data-heavy design tasks, but also allows for creative possibilities in display typography.

### A Sans for more robust layouts.

The characters within both subfamilies, Sans & Mono, maintain the exact same width across all font styles, independently of the values set on the *Weight, Casual, Slant, and Italic* axes. You can therefore use Recursive to create animated font transitions without breaking the layout of UI elements like menus and buttons.

## Ready for work. Ready for play. `CASL`

Recursive uses its *Casual* axis (`CASL`) to offer a range of personality, allowing you to get just the right tone for any context. Along this axis, letterforms adjust in stroke curvature, contrast, and terminals to go from a sturdy, rational *Linear* to a friendly, energetic *Casual*. All the styles along this axis are designed to maintain high legibility at medium and text sizes. In display sizes, it is most effective to use either end of the *Casual* axis. 

*Linear* (`CASL 0`) styles have subtly-flattened edges and simple, open forms. This optimizes readability and enables enhanced focus in dense information, such as long-form text and complex code.

*Casual* (`CASL 1`) echoes the soft & curvy brush strokes of casual signpainting, but simplifies these forms for a striking and inviting tone. This makes it ideal for web headlines, code snippets, and command line interfaces.

## Light to ExtraBlack. And everything in between. `wght`

Recursive comes in a wide range of weights, from Light (`300`) to a super-heavy ExtraBlack (`1000`). You can choose from its seven predefined weights, or set a custom value through its *Weight* (`wght`) axis. And because Recursive maintains consistent letterforms along the entire *Weight* axis, it allows for smooth animations between any of its different weights.

## Slant and Italics. Two axes that work great together, or separate. `slnt` & `ital`

In Recursive, italics and slant can be controlled separately. The *Italic* axis (`ital`) lets you switch on true italics, while the *Slant* axis (`slnt`) defines the angle of the letters. This makes it possible to use sloped romans ( `slnt -15, ital 0`), upright italics ( `slnt 0, ital 1`), or set custom values on both axes for more options to play with.  

Recursive’s true italics (`ital 1`) replace familiar letterforms with single-story cursive alternates. By default, Recursive will automatically apply these cursive alternates when setting the *Slant* axis (`slnt`) to a high value. This ensures that your code and text reads beautifully and instantly, no matter how slanted it needs to be.

## Powerful, yet simple to use.

As a variable font, Recursive gives you fine-grained control over each one of its styles. However, it also comes with 56 predefined styles that are easy to access through your font menu. Called *named instances¹*, these work just like regular static fonts do.

¹ Named instance: a predetermined location in the designspace of a variable font, similar to the "static instances" that are familiar in traditional digital fonts.

## Supports over 200 languages.

To meet the needs of global communication, Recursive supports a wide range of Latin-based languages, including Vietnamese. It also comes with an extended set of currencies, symbols, fractions, and arrows.
