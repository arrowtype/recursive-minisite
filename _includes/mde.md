## A single, flexible file. Vary nice. 

Recursive is a variable font, providing a continuous range of design control across five axes: *Proportion, Expression, Weight, Italic, and Cursive*. On the web, you can use serve the full variable font, for extreme typographic flexibility &#38; control with just a single font file. You can also serve exactly the axes you need, for all the range you need with an even smaller file size.

## Extraordinarily versatile.

Recursive draws inspiration from single-stroke casual signpainting, a style of brush writing that is highly efficient, easy to learn, stylistically flexible, and warmly energetic. Adapting this aesthetic basis into a flexible type system, Recursive is specifically designed to excel in digital interactive environments. This makes the typeface ideal for a wide range of uses, including data-rich apps, technical documentation and code editors.

### One typeface. Infinite font combinations.

Recursive is crafted with adaptability and diversity in mind, offering a complete type system but ensuring that each style can pair perfectly with its siblings. With so many possible variations across its subfamilies, weights and styles, Recursive allows for a dozen of font combinations that provide enough contrast to clearly define typographic roles, while maintaining a cohesive voice.


## Mono && Sans: Two families in one `PROP`

The typeface comes in two practical and highly readable subfamilies, Mono and Sans, and thanks to its **Proportion** axis ( PROP ), these are possible to use in a single font file (and you can even select custom instances that are semi-proportional or semi-monospaced, if you want to experiment). Vertical metrics such as line height, cap height, and x-height are shared across the proportion axis. This allows harmonious and performant layouts, even where different proportions are mixed, such as in data-rich applications and technical documentation.

**Recursive Mono** is made for code. Its characters share the same width for clear legibility and perfect alignment. This is particularly helpful for use in programming and data-heavy design tasks, but also allows for creative possibilities in display typography.

**Recursive Sans** is made for text & user interface design. Its characters are drawn within a gridded system of proportional widths to present a slightly-mechanical rhythm but also deliver comfortable reading at text sizes. The heaviest weights deliver punchy, tightly-spaced headlines.

### Made for robust layouts.

At every point along the Proportion axis (even in on the Sans side), characters share the exact same width across the Weight, Expression, Slant, and Italic axes. You can therefore use font style transitions in microinteractions to enhance the user experience of your design – without breaking the layout of UI elements like menus and buttons.

## Ready for work. Ready for play.

To provide the right tone in every context, Recursive offers a range of personality through its **Expression** axis ( XPRN ). Along this axis, letterforms employ adjust in stroke curvature, contrast, and terminals to go from a sturdy, rational Linear to a friendly, energetic *Casual*. Both sides of this axis are designed drawn with simple letterforms and open apertures to maintain clarity while also delivering a spectrum of tonal possibilities in text and captions. In display sizes, it is most effective to use either end of the Expression axis. 

**Linear** ( XPRN 0 ) styles have subtly-flattened sides and normalized shaping to optimize readability and enable enhanced focus in dense information, such as long-form text and complex code.

**Casual** ( XPRN 1 ) echoes the soft & curvy brush strokes of casual signpainting, but simplifies these forms for a striking and inviting tone in web headlines, code snippets, and command line interfaces.

## Light to Heavy.
## And everything in between. `wght`

Choose from Recursive’s seven predefined weights, from Light ( 300 ) to a super-heavy Black ( 900 ), or set a custom value through its **Weight** ( wght ) axis. Unlike most typefaces, the forms of symbols in Recursive never change abruptly along the weight axis – for instance, the dollar sign keeps the same split bar, across all weights. This allows for smooth transitions in density – even while Recursive’s weight axis also covers a wider range than most fonts, going from Light ( 300 ) to a super-heavy Black ( 900 ).

## Truer italics: `ital` && `CRSV`

Recursive comes with True Italics, available through the Italic axis ( ital ), with an additional **Slant** axis ( slnt ) to define the angle of the letters. These two axes allow you to control the “italicness” of any of Recursive’s styles independently from its slant. So, you can get a sloped Romans (with  slant -15, italic 0 ), an upright italic (with  slant 0, italic 1 ) or set custom values on both axes for more options to play with.  

Recursive’s true italics ( italic 1 ) replace familiar letterforms with more-handwritten forms. By default, Recursive will automatically apply these cursive alternates when setting the **Slant** axis ( slnt ) to a high value. This ensures that your code and text reads beautifully and instantly, no matter how slanted it needs to be.

**Slant** ( slnt ) slopes from 0° ( 0 ) to -15° ( -15 ). By default, lowercase glyphs swap for cursive alternates when the slant is above halfway.

**Italic** ( ital ) goes from Roman letterforms ( 0 ) to True Italics and their cursive alternates ( 1 ). When set to values of  0  or  1 , the Italic axis overrides the default cursive alternate behavior of the Slant axis. To let the Slant axis swap for cursive alternates automatically, set the Italic axis to any value between  0.1 ,  and  0.9 .

## Powerful, yet simple to use.

As a variable font, Recursive gives you fine-grained control over each one of its styles. However, it also comes with 56 predefined styles that are easy to access through your font menu. Called *named instances*¹, these work just like regular static fonts do.

## Supports over 200 languages.

To meet the needs of global communication, Recursive supports a wide range of Latin-based languages, as well as Vietnamese. It also comes with an extended range of currencies.

### Back this project on Kickstarter

Work is ongoing to make Recursive the best font for code & UI. 
Want to see more code ligatures in Recursive? We need your help!

Back the project on Kickstarter, and your contribution will be **doubled** by Google Fonts. This will help finance the creation of an extended set of code ligatures, allowing Recursive to provide fuller ligature support to more programming languages.

Even better, if you back one of the top tiers, you’ll receive exclusive typographic swag to show your support for open-source software – and your good taste in type.
