## Extraordinarily versatile.

Recursive draws inspiration from single-stroke casual signpainting, a style of brush writing that is stylistically flexible and warmly energetic. Adapting this aesthetic basis into a type system, Recursive is designed to excel in digital interactive environments. This makes the typeface ideal for a wide range of uses, including data-rich apps, technical documentation and code editors.
