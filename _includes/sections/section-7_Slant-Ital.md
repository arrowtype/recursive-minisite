## Slant and Cursive. Two axes that work great together, or separate. `slnt, CRSV`

In Recursive, slant and cursive letterforms can be controlled separately. The *Slant* axis (`slnt`) defines the angle of the letters, while the *Cursive* axis (`CRSV`) lets you tweak how cursive letterforms are substituted in along `slnt`.

Recursive’s cursive letterforms (`CRSV 1`) replace familiar “roman” letterforms with cursive alternates like the single-story “a” and “g”. By default, Recursive will automatically apply these cursive alternates when setting the *Slant* axis (`slnt`) beyond `-14`. This allows smooth, animated transitions from normal to oblique type up to 13.99° of slope, but also a “true italic” style with cursive letterforms at 14°. It is also possible to use sloped romans (`slnt -15, CRSV 0`), upright italics (`slnt 0, CRSV 1`), or set custom values on both axes for more options to play with.
