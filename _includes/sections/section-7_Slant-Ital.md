## Slant and Italics. Two axes that work great together, or separate. `slnt` & `ital`

In Recursive, italics and slant can be controlled separately. The *Italic* axis (`ital`) lets you switch on true italics, while the *Slant* axis (`slnt`) defines the angle of the letters. This makes it possible to use sloped romans ( `slnt -15, ital 0`), upright italics ( `slnt 0, ital 1`), or set custom values on both axes for more options to play with.  

Recursiveâ€™s true italics (`ital 1`) replace familiar letterforms with single-story cursive alternates. By default, Recursive will automatically apply these cursive alternates when setting the *Slant* axis (`slnt`) to a high value. This ensures that your code and text reads beautifully and instantly, no matter how slanted it needs to be.
