## Light to ExtraBlack. And everything in between. `wght`

Recursive comes in a wide range of weights, from Light (`300`) to a super-heavy ExtraBlack (`1000`). You can choose from its seven predefined weights, or set a custom value through its *Weight* (`wght`) axis. And because Recursive maintains consistent letterforms along the entire *Weight* axis, it allows for smooth animations between any of its different weights.
