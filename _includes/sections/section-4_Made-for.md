### A Sans for more robust layouts.

The characters within both subfamilies, Sans & Mono, maintain the exact same width across all font styles, independently of the values set on the *Weight, Casual, Slant, and Cursive* axes. You can therefore use Recursive to create animated font transitions without breaking the layout of UI elements like menus and buttons.
