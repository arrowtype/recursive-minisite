### Made for robust layouts.

The characters within both subfamilies, Sans & Mono, maintain the exact same width across all font styles, independently of the values set on the *Weight, Expression, Slant, and Italic* axes. You can therefore use Recursive to create animated font transitions without breaking the layout of UI elements like menus and buttons.
