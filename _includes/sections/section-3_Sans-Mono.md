### One typeface. Infinite font combinations.

Recursive is crafted with adaptability and diversity in mind, offering a complete type system but ensuring that each style can pair perfectly with its siblings. With so many possible variations across its subfamilies, weights and styles, Recursive allows for a dozen of font combinations that provide enough contrast to clearly define typographic roles, while maintaining a cohesive voice.


## Sans & Mono â€“ Two families in one. `PROP`

The typeface comes in two practical and highly readable subfamilies, Sans and Mono. Thanks to its *Monospace* axis (`MONO`) both of these subfamilies can be used in a single font file. You can even select custom instances that are semi-proportional or semi-monospaced. 

Also, vertical metrics such as line height, cap height, and x-height are shared across the entire *Monospace* axis. This allows harmonious and performant layouts, even where different proportions are mixed, such as in data-rich applications and technical documentation. 

*Recursive Sans* is made for text & user interface design. While its proportional characters deliver comfortable reading at text sizes, its heaviest weights are perfect to create punchy, tightly-spaced headlines.

*Recursive Mono* is made for code. Its characters share the same width for clear legibility and perfect alignment. This is particularly helpful for use in programming and data-heavy design tasks, but also allows for creative possibilities in display typography.
