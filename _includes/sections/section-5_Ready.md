## Ready for work. Ready for play. `XPRN`

Recursive uses its *Expression* axis (`XPRN`) to offer a range of personality, allowing you to get just the right tone for any context. Along this axis, letterforms adjust in stroke curvature, contrast, and terminals to go from a sturdy, rational *Linear* to a friendly, energetic *Casual*. All the styles along this axis are designed to maintain high legibility at medium and text sizes. In display sizes, it is most effective to use either end of the *Expression* axis. 

*Linear* (`XPRN 0`) styles have subtly-flattened edges and simple, open forms. This optimizes readability and enables enhanced focus in dense information, such as long-form text and complex code.

*Casual* (`XPRN  1`) echoes the soft & curvy brush strokes of casual signpainting, but simplifies these forms for a striking and inviting tone. This makes it ideal for web headlines, code snippets, and command line interfaces.
