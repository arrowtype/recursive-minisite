Recursive draws inspiration from single-stroke casual signpainting, a style of brush writing that is stylistically flexible and warmly energetic. Adapting this aesthetic basis into a type system, Recursive is designed to excel in digital interactive environments. This makes the typeface ideal for a wide range of uses, including data-rich apps, technical documentation and code editors.

### One typeface. Infinite font combinations.

Recursive is crafted with adaptability and diversity in mind, offering a complete type system but ensuring that each style can pair perfectly with its siblings. With so many possible variations across its subfamilies, weights and styles, Recursive allows for a dozen of font combinations that provide enough contrast to clearly define typographic roles, while maintaining a cohesive voice.

## Sans & Mono â€“ Two families in one. `MONO`

The typeface comes in two practical and highly readable subfamilies, Sans and Mono. Thanks to its *Monospace* axis (`MONO`) both of these subfamilies can be used in a single font file. You can even select custom instances that are semi-proportional or semi-monospaced. 

Also, vertical metrics such as line height, cap height, and x-height are shared across the entire *Monospace* axis. This allows harmonious and performant layouts, even where different proportions are mixed, such as in data-rich applications and technical documentation. 

*Recursive Sans* is made for text & user interface design. While its proportional characters deliver comfortable reading at text sizes, its heaviest weights are perfect to create punchy, tightly-spaced headlines.

*Recursive Mono* is made for code. Its characters share the same width for clear legibility and perfect alignment. This is particularly helpful for use in programming and data-heavy design tasks, but also allows for creative possibilities in display typography.

### Made for robust layouts.

The characters within both subfamilies, Sans & Mono, maintain the exact same width across all font styles, independently of the values set on the *Weight, Expression, Slant, and Italic* axes. You can therefore use Recursive to create animated font transitions without breaking the layout of UI elements like menus and buttons.


## Ready for work. Ready for play. `XPRN`

Recursive uses its *Expression* axis (`XPRN`) to offer a range of personality, allowing you to get just the right tone for any context. Along this axis, letterforms adjust in stroke curvature, contrast, and terminals to go from a sturdy, rational *Linear* to a friendly, energetic *Casual*. All the styles along this axis are designed to maintain high legibility at medium and text sizes. In display sizes, it is most effective to use either end of the *Expression* axis. 

*Linear* (`XPRN 0`) styles have subtly-flattened edges and simple, open forms. This optimizes readability and enables enhanced focus in dense information, such as long-form text and complex code.

*Casual* (`XPRN  1`) echoes the soft & curvy brush strokes of casual signpainting, but simplifies these forms for a striking and inviting tone. This makes it ideal for web headlines, code snippets, and command line interfaces.


## Light to Heavy. And everything in between. `wght`

Recursive comes in a wide range of weights, from Light (`300`) to a super-heavy Black (`900`). You can choose from its seven predefined weights, or set a custom value through its *Weight* (`wght`) axis. And because Recursive maintains consistent letterforms along the entire *Weight* axis, it allows for smooth animations between any of its different weights.
