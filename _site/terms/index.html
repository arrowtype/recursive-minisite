<p>This privacy statement was last updated March 28, 2019</p>

<p>These Terms of Service (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) apply to your access to and use of the websites, mobile applications, mobile keyboards and other online products and services (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>”) provided by Holler Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (“<strong>Holler</strong>” or “<strong>we</strong>”), with a principal place of business at 22 W. 38th Street, Floor 2, New York, NY 10018. <strong>By clicking “I Accept” or by using our Services, you agree to these Terms, including the mandatory arbitration provision and class action waiver in Section 16. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use our Services.</strong></p>

<p>We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will provide you with notice of such changes, such as by sending an email, providing a notice through our Services or updating the date at the top of these Terms. Unless we say otherwise in our notice, the amended Terms will be effective immediately, and your continued use of our Services after we provide such notice will confirm your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using our Services.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about these Terms or our Services, please contact us at privacy@holler.io</p>

<p><strong>2. Eligibility</strong></p>

<p>You must be at least the age of legal majority in your country to use our Services. If you are under 18 years of age (or the age of legal majority where you live), you may use our Services only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a user under the age of 18 (or the age of legal majority), you agree to be fully responsible for the acts or omissions of such user in relation to our Services. If you use our Services on behalf of another person or entity, (a) all references to “you” throughout these Terms will include that person or entity, (b) you represent that you are authorized to accept these Terms on that person’s or entity’s behalf, and (c) in the event you or the person or entity violates these Terms, the person or entity agrees to be responsible to us.</p>

<p>You may need to register for an account to access some or all of our Services. If you register for an account, you must provide accurate account information and promptly update this information if it changes. You also must maintain the security of your account and promptly notify us if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your account without your permission. If you permit others to use your account credentials, you are responsible for the activities of such users that occur in connection with your account. We reserve the right to reclaim usernames, including on behalf of businesses or individuals that hold legal claim, including trademark rights, in those usernames.</p>

<p>You are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using our Services, including text-messaging and data charges. If you’re unsure what those charges may be, ask your service provider before using our Services.</p>

<p>Our Services may allow you and other users to create, post, store and share content, including messages, graphics, emojis, text, photos, videos, software and other materials (collectively, “<strong>User Content</strong>”).

When you post or otherwise share User Content on or through our Services, you understand that your User Content and any associated information (such as your username or profile photo) may be visible to others.</p>

<p>You may not create, post, store or share any User Content that violates these Terms or for which you do not have all the rights necessary to grant us the license described above. You represent and warrant that your User Content, and our use of such content as permitted by these Terms, will not violate any rights of or cause injury to any person or entity.

<p>Enforcement of this Section 5 is solely at Holler’s discretion, and failure to enforce this section in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce it in other instances.  In addition, this Section 5 does not create any private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.</p>

<p><strong>6. Ownership; Limited License</strong></p>

<p>The Services, including the text, graphics, emojis, images, photographs, videos, illustrations and other content contained therein, are owned by Holler or our licensors and are protected under both United States and foreign laws.

<p><strong>9. Repeat Infringer Policy; Copyright Complaints</strong></p>

<p>In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other applicable law, we have adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances, the accounts of users who repeatedly infringe the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that anything on our Services infringes any copyright that you own or control, you may notify Holler’s designated agent as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Designated Agent:</strong> Perkins Coie LLP</p>

<p><strong>Address:</strong> 30 Rockefeller Plaza 22nd Floor, New York, NY 10112-0015</p>

<p><strong>E-Mail Address:</strong> dmca@holler.io</p>

<p>Please see <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title17/pdf/USCODE-2011-title17-chap5-sec512.pdf">17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)</a> for the requirements of a proper notification. Also, please note that if you knowingly misrepresent that any activity or material on our Services is infringing, you may be liable to Holler for certain costs and damages.</p>

<p><strong>10. Third-Party Content; Third-Party Services</strong></p>

<p>We may provide information about third-party products, services, activities or events, or we may allow third parties to make their content and information available on or through the Services (collectively, “<strong>Third-Party Content</strong>”). We provide Third-Party Content as a service to those interested in such content. Your dealings or correspondence with third parties and your use of or interaction with any Third-Party Content are solely between you and the third party. Holler does not control or endorse, and makes no representations or warranties regarding, any Third-Party Content, and your access to and use of such Third-Party Content is at your own risk.</p>

<p>If you use a service, feature, or functionality that is operated by a third party and made available through our Services (including Services we jointly offer with a third party), each party’s terms will govern the respective party’s relationship with you. Holler is not responsible or liable for those third-party terms or actions taken under the third-party’s terms.</p>

<p><strong>11. Indemnification</strong></p>

<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Holler and our subsidiaries and affiliates, and each of our respective officers, directors, agents, partners and employees (individually and collectively, the “<strong>Holler Parties</strong>”) from and against any losses, liabilities, claims, demands, damages, expenses or costs (“<strong>Claims</strong>”) arising out of or related to (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) your User Content or Feedback; (c) your violation of these Terms; (d) your violation, misappropriation or infringement of any rights of another (including intellectual property rights or privacy rights); or (e) your conduct in connection with the Services. You agree to promptly notify Holler Parties of any third-party Claims, cooperate with Holler Parties in defending such Claims and pay all fees, costs and expenses associated with defending such Claims (including, but not limited to, attorneys’ fees). You also agree that the Holler Parties will have control of the defense or settlement, at Holler’s sole option, of any third-party Claims. This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in a written agreement between you and Holler or the other Holler Parties.</p>

<p><strong>12. Disclaimers</strong></p>

<p>Your use of our Services is at your sole risk. Except as otherwise provided in a writing by us, our Services and any content therein are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. In addition, Holler does not represent or warrant that our Services are accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free. While Holler attempts to make your use of our Services and any content therein safe, we cannot and do not represent or warrant that our Services or servers are free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Services.</p>

<p><strong>13. Limitation of Liability</strong></p>

<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Holler and the other Holler Parties will not be liable to you under any theory of liability—whether based in contract, tort, negligence, warranty, or otherwise—for any indirect, consequential, incidental or special damages or lost profits, even if Holler or the other Holler Parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

<p>The total liability of Holler and the other Holler Parties for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services, regardless of the form of the action, is limited to the greater of $200 or the amount paid by you to use our Services.</p>

<p>The limitations set forth in this Section 13 will not limit or exclude liability for the gross negligence, fraud or intentional misconduct of Holler or the other Holler Parties or for any other matters in which liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. Additionally, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.</p>

<p><strong>14. Release</strong></p>

<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release Holler and the other Holler Parties from responsibility, liability, claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related to disputes between users and the acts or omissions of third parties. If you are a consumer who resides in California, you hereby waive your rights under California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”</p>

<p><strong>15. Transfer and Processing Data</strong></p>

<p>In order for us to provide our Services, you agree that we may process, transfer and store information about you in the United States and other countries, where you may not have the same rights and protections as you do under local law. Please see our Privacy Statement at https://www.emogi.com/privacy for additional information.</p>

<p><strong>16. Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration</strong></p>

<p>Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Holler and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration agreement. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.</p>

<p>No Representative Actions. You and Holler agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Holler and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.</p>

<p><strong>Arbitration of Disputes.</strong> Except for small claims disputes in which you or Holler seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or Holler seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, <strong>you and Holler waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court.</strong> Instead, for any dispute or claim that you have against Holler or relating in any way to the Services, including, without limitation, any claims with respect to privacy or data security, you agree to first contact Holler and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“<strong>Notice</strong>”) to Holler by email at legal@holler.io or by certified mail addressed to 22 W 38th St New York, NY 10018. The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and Holler cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in New York, New York in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“<strong>JAMS Rules</strong>”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/">JAMS website</a> and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>

<p>You and Holler agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 16 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, <em>et seq</em>. (the “<em>FAA</em>”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>

<p>The arbitrator, Holler, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</p>

<p>You and Holler agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and Holler will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Holler, Holler will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Holler agree that the state or federal courts of the State of New York and the United States sitting in New York, New York have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.</p>

<p>Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Holler will not have the right to assert the claim.</p>

<p>You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 16 by emailing us at legal@holler.io. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with Section 17.</p>

<p>If any portion of this Section 16 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 16 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 16; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 16 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 16 will be enforceable.</p>

<p><strong>17. Governing Law and Venue</strong></p>

<p>Any dispute arising from these Terms and your use of the Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York except to the extent preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of the State of New York and the United States, respectively, sitting in New York, New York.</p>
